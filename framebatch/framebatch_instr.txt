#### Instructions for doing gapfills on LiCS networks as of 01/03/23 ####

#### By Jess Payne eejap@leeds.ac.uk ####
#### Inspired by Andrew Watson github.com/andwatson ####

1) Before you can process on JASMIN, you'll need an account and permissions. A guide for
acquiring these can be found at:
https://gitlab.com/comet_licsar/licsar_documentation/-/wikis/home

2) You will also need to be a member of:
comet_lics (group workspace)
nceo_geohazards (group workspace)
nceo_lics (group workspace)
hpxfer (additional service)
... on JASMIN

2a) You will also need access to the COMET queue!
Email JASMIN cc'ing in Yasser/Milan to ask for access to the COMET queue (otherwise you have to use short-serial and
won't be able to download anything from the COMET Portal when using LiCSBAS).

3) Familiarise yourself with the slurm processing system:
https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/category/4889-slurm

4) Set up JASMIN fingerprints etc. Would recommend doing this on holly or other server rather than locally.
Log into JASMIN via:
a) exec ssh-agent $SHELL
b) ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_jasmin
c) ssh -X -A eejap002@login1.jasmin.ac.uk

5) Log into a sci server. Avoid 3 and 6, e.g.:
ssh -X -A eejap002@sci.jasmin.ac.uk

6) Get LiCS commands up and running:
a) Add to your ~/.bashrc file the line:
module use "/gws/smf/j04/nceo_geohazards/software/Modules/"
a) Run:
module load licsar_framebatch_testing
b) Run:
b) source /gws/smf/j04/nceo_geohazards/software/mambalics/load_mambalics.rc
... you will now have access to licsar_framebatch codes (and many other codes created by Milan and Yasser to do all things LiCS).
... see https://comet-licsar.github.io/index.html# and https://gitlab.com/comet_licsar for more info.

7) You will have a number of variables set e.g.:
$LiCSAR_temp <- your temp processing directory
$LiCSAR_procdir <- path for the main working directory of the automated system
$LiCSAR_public <- path to the public directories you can see on the LiCS portal
... $LiCSAR_temp may not exist so maybe create that.

8) Go to /work/scratch-pw3/licsar/ if you are running licsar things and make a directory for yourself.
You will do processing here and then save outputs elsewhere. All files here are deleted after 28 days of their creation.
Be careful or 'touch' them regularly.

9) For framebatch processing, make a directory 'batchdir' for processing in.
mkdir batchdir

10) Set the BATCH_CACHE_DIR variable in this new directory:
export BATCH_CACHE_DIR=`pwd`

11) Set the variable $frame to your frame of interest e.g.
frame=035D_05397_131013

12) Check the status of this frame with:
getFrameStatus.py $frame 1

Check status of all Iran frames by running
./check_active.sh
... if either command returns a username, the frame is active and any processing jobs will fail. Either wait for this user to finish
or ask them if they are finished. Often yma (Yasser) is active as he is running the monthly update.
If your username is active on a frame, you can set it to be inactive using:
setFrameInactive.py $frame

13) framebatch_update_frame.sh can run three main types of job:
Upfill - processes ifgs from the last three months.
Backfill - processes ifgs backwards from the old ifg.
Gapfill - processes ifgs between two dates.

Upfill is ran for most frames monthly by the autoprocessing system.
Mostly for Iran we run gapfills where monthly update for whatever reason didn't run over that period of time.

14) Make directory in your batchdir directory to collect the batch processing error and out logs:
mkdir sbatch_logs
... you are ready to process :)

15) Example command for gapfill:
sbatch -A comet -p comet -o sbatch_logs/$frame.gapfill.out -e sbatch_logs/$frame.gapfill.err -t 72:00:00 framebatch_update_frame.sh -k -P $frame gapfill 20141001 20190901

What does this mean?
sbatch : submits a job to the queue.
-A and -P : requests jobs go to the comet queue to process.
-o sbatch_logs/$frame.gapfill.out : writes the output to a text file.
-e sbatch_logs/$frame.gapfill.err : writes any errors to a text file.
-t 72:00:00 : requests a max runtime of 72 hours.
framebatch_update_frame.sh : our command.
-k : keeps the processing directory after completely (deletes by default).
-P : uses comet queue for sub-jobs.
$frame : frame of interest.
gapfill 20141001 20190901 : runs gapfill between these two dates.

...would advise being generous with your gap. Extend dates at least 1 month either side of gap to ensure gap is filled 'strongly'.

Run this command in your BATCH_CACHE_DIR (here batchdir).
This command will create a frame directory to collect the outputs of gapfilling.
Remember .err and .out files are collected in sbatch_logs outside of this frame directory.

16) Would recommend setting up a shortcut in your ~.bashrc file to monitor jobs e.g.

#-aliases:
alias sq='squeue --user=eejap002 --states=all -o "%.18i %.9P %.50j %.8T %.10M %.5m %.9l %.6D %R"'

Typing sq will simply show status of any jobs you have run :)

17) framebatch_update_frame.sh will first run an NLA request. Monitor this with:
nla_check_status.sh
... which will tell you if your requests are:
No queued yet
Active
On Disk

... The gapfill job should run automatically when the nla request is "On Disk".
... If not, NLA request may take days to complete (hence 72hr limit for the sbatch job above!!)

18) Your job might finish (yay) which means you can check your frame directory and .err and .out jobs to see how it went.
If new ifgs are successfully created, they will exist in GEOC/. This will include softlinks to existing ifgs on the portal.
Also, there should be one SLC in the SLC/ dir: the master SLC. If more than one SLC is here then you need to run some more
coregistration jobs.

19) To run more coregistration jobs, run ./postproc_coreg.sh in the frame directory.
Also try stepping through the *nowait* commands in order from where you think the framebatch jobs have not worked:
e.g. if you think not all SLCs have coregistered, run from framebatch_02_coreg.nowait.sh

To run through all the nowait commands without having to manually do it, ./framebatch_x_second_iteration.nowait.sh
works quite well.

20) Check any ifgs that have been generated by running the below in the GEOC/ dir
(running below is same as running ./montage_new_ifgs.sh in GEOC).

mkdir tocheck
find -type d -name "2*_2*" | awk '{print substr($1,3,17)}' > tocheck/new_ifgs.txt
cd tocheck/
for ifg in `cat new_ifgs.txt`; do ln -s `readlink -f ../$ifg/$ifg.geo.unw.png` .; done
montage_months.sh

This creates softlinks for the newly created unwrapped ifgs, and then montage_months.sh creates montage images for each month.
You can then either look through these using display on jasmin, or copy them locally and use eog, which can be a bit faster.

21) Delete any bad ifgs from GEOC using e.g.:
rm -rf 20150911_20151017

22) Store good ifgs to the public portal using:
sbatch -A comet -p comet -o sbatch_logs/$frame.store.out -e sbatch_logs/$frame.store.err -t 72:00:00 store_to_curdir.sh $frame
... run this in $BATCH_CACHE_DIR (batchdir)

23) Also update GACOS corrections on the portal using:
sbatch -A comet -p comet -o sbatch_logs/$frame.gacos.out -e sbatch_logs/$frame.gacos.err -t 72:00:00 framebatch_update_gacos.sh $frame
... also run in $BATCH_CACHE_DIR (batchdir)

Andrew W ran ./gacos_check.sh to check which epochs needed GACOS. This didn't really work for me, and anyway the LiCS Portal tells you
what %GACOS any frame has. Worth running framebatch_update_gacos.sh most of the time anyway without checking first.

24) The network.png also needs updating. In the frame directory, run firstly:
update_bperp_file.sh

and after that:

cd $LiCSAR_public/*/$frame
plot_network.py `pwd` metadata/network.png metadata/gaps.txt

Andrew W ran ./update_network_plot.sh to do these two steps in one but this script doesn't work for me.

N.b. If you cannot see updated network.png on LiCS online portal, try clearing cache in your browser then reloading the network plot.

25) You should be done :) but maybe this took a while. Congrats. Troubleshoot with Milan and Yasser (or me...) on any weird errors.
