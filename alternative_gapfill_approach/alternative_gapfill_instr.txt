#### Instructions for doing gapfills on LiCS networks as of 29/05/24 ####

#### By Jess Payne eejap@leeds.ac.uk ####
#### Inspired by Andrew Watson github.com/andwatson ####

N.b. this approach is recommended by Muhammet Nergizci (PhD at Leeds) who was recommended this by 
Jack McGrath (formerly PhD student at Leeds, now at GNS). Use this approach if having problems
with NLA, ASF auto-download, or co-registration of SLCs to form RSLCs.

Usually using framebatch gapfill approach should be suitable (see /lics_resources/framebatch).

1) Before you can process on JASMIN, you'll need an account and permissions. A guide for
acquiring these can be found at:
https://gitlab.com/comet_licsar/licsar_documentation/-/wikis/home

2) You will also need to be a member of:
comet_lics (group workspace)
nceo_geohazards (group workspace)
nceo_lics (group workspace)
hpxfer (additional service)
... on JASMIN

2a) You will also need access to the COMET queue!
Email JASMIN cc'ing in Yasser/Milan to ask for access to the COMET queue (otherwise you have to use short-serial and
won't be able to download anything from the COMET Portal when using LiCSBAS).

3) Familiarise yourself with the slurm processing system:
https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/category/4889-slurm

4) Set up JASMIN fingerprints etc. Would recommend doing this on holly or other server rather than locally.
Log into JASMIN via:
a) exec ssh-agent $SHELL
b) ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_jasmin
c) ssh -X -A eejap002@login1.jasmin.ac.uk

5) Log into a sci server. Avoid 3 and 6, e.g.:
ssh -X -A eejap002@sci.jasmin.ac.uk

6) Get LiCS commands up and running:
a) Add to your ~/.bashrc file the line:
module use "/gws/smf/j04/nceo_geohazards/software/Modules/"
a) Run:
module load licsar_framebatch_testing
b) Run:
b) source /gws/smf/j04/nceo_geohazards/software/mambalics/load_mambalics.rc
... you will now have access to licsar_framebatch codes (and many other codes created by Milan and Yasser to do all things LiCS).
... see https://comet-licsar.github.io/index.html# and https://gitlab.com/comet_licsar for more info.

7) You will have a number of variables set e.g.:
$LiCSAR_temp <- your temp processing directory
$LiCSAR_procdir <- path for the main working directory of the automated system
$LiCSAR_public <- path to the public directories you can see on the LiCS portal
... $LiCSAR_temp may not exist so maybe create that.

8) Go to /work/scratch-pw3/licsar/ if you are running licsar things and make a directory for yourself.
You will do processing here and then save outputs elsewhere. All files here are deleted after 28 days of their creation.
Be careful or 'touch' them regularly.

9) For framebatch processing, make a directory 'batchdir' for processing in.
mkdir batchdir

10) Set the BATCH_CACHE_DIR variable in this new directory:
export BATCH_CACHE_DIR=`pwd`

11) Set the variable $frame to your frame of interest e.g.
frame=035D_05397_131013

12) Check the status of this frame with:
getFrameStatus.py $frame 1

13) Open tmux window by running:
tmux
...in command line. Exit tmux window by Ctrl+B, D.
...reattach to tmux window with:
tmux a -t 0
...where 0 or another number is the tmux session you want to attach to.

14) Run for your frame LiCSAR_0_getFiles.py to run an NLA request for missing epoch data (in $batchdir):
LiCSAR_0_getFiles.py -f $frame -s 2017-07-01 -e 2019-03-17 -r -b Y -n
-f = frame
-s = start date
-e = end date
-r = make NLA request
-b = batch mode to use with NLA request; W - week, M - month, Y - year
-n = notify user's default email when request submitted

15) Leave this running in a tmux terminal until it is finished. You can check the status
of your NLA request with:
nla_check_status.sh

16) Run licsar_make_frame.sh in $batchdir to step auto through LiCSAR scripts:
licsar_make_frame.sh $frame 0 1 2019-01-01 2021-01-01

17) Hopefully this step 16 should auto work and everything will produced correctly. If not, try
running framebatch_postproc_coreg.sh:
framebatch_postproc_coreg.sh -f $frame 1
...which forces through RSLCs even if temporal baseline is longer than 180 days.

18) Finally run licsar_make_frame.sh again to push through other LiCSAR steps post co-registration.

19) Pick up from /lics_resources/framebatch/framebatch_instr.txt step 18 :)

n.b. currently testing 15-18.
